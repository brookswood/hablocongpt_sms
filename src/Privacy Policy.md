Privacy Policy
Last updated: May 13, 2023

Please see our Privacy Snapshot for a high-level overview of our privacy practices.

This Privacy Policy outlines how GPTPODCAST, LLC. (“GPTPODCAST”, “we”, “us”) your personal information through our website – www.convoswithgpt.com, our mobile applications, our interactions with you through other modes of communication (such as SMS or instant messaging), and any other sites or services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Services”).

Our General Approach

Conversational artificial intelligence is at the technological frontier. We believe that this emerging technology will fundamentally change the way that we engage with and think about computers in our everyday lives. Ultimately, our goal is to use AI to build safe, smart, kind, and engaging conversational partners.

Our Privacy Policy reflects our belief that achieving this goal and making the technology truly useful for all will require a deep understanding of how our users talk and collaborate with AIs. As users interact with our AIs, we learn a lot about how to make AI better and more useful to you.

Users deserve transparency regarding how that process works, particularly when it comes to their data. This Policy is one part of that transparency. It documents what data we collect, how we keep it secure, and describes how we use that data to improve our Services for everyone. Here are the top level points:

When you use Our Platform, we collect data including your name, phone number, and IP address. We use this data to run Our Platform, inform improvements to the platform, keep you safe, and comply with all applicable laws.
Keeping your conversations with Our Platform private and safe is our top priority, and we will never sell or share your data for advertising or marketing purposes. We have strict internal controls over the use of and access to user data.
You agree to follow our Acceptable Use policy. When you talk to Our Platform, you should not try to get it to talk about harmful, abusive, or illegal topics. You also should not attempt to evade our security measures or learn about the models, algorithms, prompts, or source code of Our Platform. If our automated systems detect this activity, you may be suspended.
You are not permitted to use Our Platform if you are under the age of 18.
Our Platform may make up facts, events, or advice. You should never rely on anything it tells you without double-checking the facts yourself or, if appropriate, talking to a professional.

Security

Security is integral to the success of conversational AI: people need to trust that their data is being handled responsibly and safely in order to fully get the benefits of our Services.

Ensuring the integrity of your data is a major priority for us. GPTPODCAST has technical measures in place to protect personal information against unauthorized access, corruption, loss, or misuse. This includes internal measures that limit access to personal information to a dedicated set of specialist employees working on improving the safety or quality of our Services. Where possible and appropriate, we also deidentify sensitive data like conversational logs to preserve user privacy.

However, these measures are not a guarantee of absolute security and you acknowledge and accept that your use of our Services is ultimately at your own risk.

Also, please note that you are responsible for managing access to any accounts that you maintain with GPTPODCAST. Failure to limit access to your devices or browser might enable third-parties to have unauthorized access to your personal information.
